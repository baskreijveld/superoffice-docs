# PUT Document/{id}/Content

```http
PUT /api/v1/Document/{documentId}/Content
```

Store document content from stream.


Since there is a potential for a name conflict (the file name stored by the document entity earlier may prove to be invalid), the (possibly amended) document entity is returned. The client should not assume that any earlier, cached entity information is valid.

| documentId | int32 | The document entity object that the binary data (document) should be stored to. Its file name may be amended by this call, see the return value. **Required** |
